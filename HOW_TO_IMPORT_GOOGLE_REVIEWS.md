## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Will this post all my reviews publicly?**  
No! Everything imports as **unpublished**. You decide what to share.

**Q: What if I've already reviewed some places in Pachu?**  
The import is smart! It skips restaurants you've already reviewed.

**Q: How long does it take?**  
- Google export: 5-30 minutes (they email you when ready)
- Pachu import: Usually under 30 seconds
- Total: About 30 minutes including Google's processing time

**Q: Can I import reviews multiple times?**  
Yes, but it will only add NEW reviews you haven't shared yet.

**Q: What if something goes wrong?**  
The import gives you a detailed report. If some reviews don't import, it tells you why!

**Q: Will my Google reviews be deleted?**  
Never! Your Google reviews stay exactly as they are. This just makes a copy in Pachu.
